# DPtraj
A double-polynomial discription for trajectory interfaced with learning-based front end.
The code will come in middle July.

This work is presented in the paper: Hierarchically Depicting Vehicle Trajectory with Stability in Complex Environments, published in Science Robotics.

The backend trajectory optimizer improvements build upon our previous work (available at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Dftpav), where singularity issues were addressed. 

Moreover, the approach has recently been extended and applied to more complex multi-joint robotic platforms (see https://github.com/Tracailer/Tracailer).
